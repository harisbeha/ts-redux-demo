# Typescript Redux Example
Simple demonstration of how I approach designing a React / Redux application. This demo does not contain any usage of React Router, Higher Order Components (HoCs) or extensive use of Promises / Async functionality.

Scaffolding was done using create-react-app, with a lot of the cruft removed. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Opens [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
